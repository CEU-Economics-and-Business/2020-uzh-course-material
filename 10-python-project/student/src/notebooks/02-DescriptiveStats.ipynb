    "#### Details about timing is as follows. \n",
    "The start of the period is 1991 and then end is 2007. \n",
    "This is then divided into two periods. \n",
    "The first periods is 1991-2000, thus this is a 9 year time period. \n",
    "They convert stuff into a \"comparable decadal scale\" see Footnote 22. \n",
    "Thus, for values for this period, they multiply them by 10/9.\n",
    "The same issue arises for the second period which is 2000-2007. \n",
    "The values for this are again converted to \"decadal scales\" so they are multiplied by 10/7.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Appendix Table 2, reports the income variable and the decadal adjustments. \n",
    "In the summary statistics for the stuff that we care about, the ADH data is adjusted in this way described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Details about variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, variables starting with 'l' are in levels whereas variables starting with 'd' are the decadal equivalents.\n",
    "\n",
    "As necessary, we will tell you which variable to use, so that $*_somevariable$ means to choose the appropriate level or decadal equivalent. We leave you to figure out which of the $l$ or $d$ variables to use. Do ask us if you are confused."
