# Replicating Results from AJR

Goal of exercise: replicate some results from

The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation
by Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson AER 2001.

The link to where data is stored is here:

1. Download the data from above to construct results from Table 2 (maketable2.dta)
2. Regress log gdp per capita in 95 (logpgp95) against average expropriation risk (avexpr)
3. Extend (2) by adding latitude
4. Extend (3) by adding factor variables for Asia, Africa and "other continent"
5. Present the results from 2 - 4 in a stargazer table
6. Modify (5) so you have robust standard errors (try HC2)  for each model.
7. Download the data for Table 4 (maketable4.dta)
8. Estimate an IV regression of log gdp per capita in 95 on average expropriation risk. Use Settler mortality as the instrument (logem4). Only use data where baseco ==1.
9. Repeat 3,4 for the IV regression
10. Make a stargazer table that compares the IV and OLS results with robust standard errors
11. What were the F-statistics for the first stage regressions in 8 and 9?
